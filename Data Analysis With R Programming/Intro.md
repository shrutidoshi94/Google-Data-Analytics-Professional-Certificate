# The R-versus-Python debate

People often wonder which programming language they should learn first. You might be wondering about this, too. This program teaches the open-source programming language, R, which is used for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis. R is a great starting point for foundational data analysis, and it has helpful packages that beginners can apply to projects. Python is a general-purpose programming language that isn’t covered in the curriculum. However, we encourage you to explore Python after completing this program. If you’re curious about other programming languages, make every effort to continue learning.

Any programming language a beginner starts to learn will have some advantages and challenges. Explore this by examining the characteristics of R and Python in the following table, which provides a high-level overview based on a sampling of articles and opinions of those in the field. You can review the information without necessarily picking a side in the R versus Python debate. In fact, if you explore Posit’s [blog article](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/12/17/r-vs-python-what-s-the-best-for-language-for-data-science/) in the Resources for more information section, it’s actually more about working together than winning a debate.

## Expand your skills to other programming languages

As you grow as a data analytics professional, you may need to learn additional programming languages. The skills and competencies you learn from your first programming experience are a good foundation. That's why this course focuses on the basics of R. Many of the concepts and coding principles that you will learn as you use R in this course are transferable to other programming languages.

You’ll write R code in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called RStudio, which is offered by Posit. Posit allows you to manage projects that use R or Python, or even a combination of the two. So, after you’ve worked with R and RStudio, learning Python or another programming language in the future will be more intuitive.

## Programming language by job role

R is typically used by professionals who have a statistical or research-oriented approach to solving problems; among them are scientists, statisticians, and engineers. Python is typically used by professionals who want to find solutions in the data itself, such as those who must heavily mine data for answers; among them are data scientists, machine learning specialists, and software developers. You’ll gain a better understanding of popular programming languages by job role later in this course.

## Key takeaways

In this course, you’ll learn the basics of R, which is often used by professionals who have a statistical or research-oriented approach to solving problems. Python is a general-purpose programming language often used by data scientists, machine learning specialists, and software developers.

# From spreadsheets to SQL to R

Although the programming language R might be new to you, it actually has a lot of similarities to the other tools you have explored in this program. In this reading, you will compare spreadsheet programs, SQL, and R to have a better sense of how to use each moving forward.

![Image of person thinking with 3 speech bubbles: one has a bar chart, one has a spreadsheet, and one has the word "function"](./assets/2.png)

## Spreadsheets, SQL, and R: a comparison

As a data analyst, there is a good chance you will work with SQL, R, and spreadsheets at some point in your career. Each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses, but they all make the data analysis process smoother and more efficient. There are two main things that all three have in common:

* **They all use filters: **for example, you can easily filter a dataset using any of these tools. In R, you can use the filter function. This performs the same task as a basic SELECT-FROM-WHERE SQL query. In a spreadsheet, you can create a filter using the menu options.
* **They all use functions: **In spreadsheets, you use functions in formulas, and in SQL, you include them in queries. In R, you will use functions in the code that is part of your analysis.

The table below presents key questions to explore a few more ways that these tools compare to each other. You can use this as a general guide as you begin to navigate R.

One of the exciting things about all of the tools you’ve been learning is that they are often used together. For example, you could use SQL to pull a specific dataset, clean and organize it in R, and then export it as a spreadsheet for quick insights. As you learn more about R, you may discover even more exciting ways it can be combined with other tools in your toolkit!

# When to use RStudio

As a data analyst, you will have plenty of tools to work with in each phase of your analysis. Sometimes, you will be able to meet your objectives by working in a spreadsheet program or using SQL with a database. In this reading, you will go through some examples of when working in R and RStudio might be your better option instead.

![Image of maintenance worker handing a wrench tool to an office worker who is sitting at their desk](./assets/3.png)

## Why RStudio?

One of your core tasks as an analyst will be converting raw data into insights that are accurate, useful, and interesting. That can be tricky to do when the raw data is complex. R and RStudio are designed to handle large data sets, which spreadsheets might not be able to handle as well. RStudio also makes it easy to reproduce your work on different datasets. When you input your code, it's simple to just load a new dataset and run your scripts again. You can also create more detailed visualizations using RStudio.

## When RStudio truly shines

When the data is spread across multiple categories or groups, it can be challenging to manage your analysis, visualize trends, and build graphics. And the more groups of data that you need to work with, the harder those tasks become. That’s where RStudio comes in.

For example, imagine you are analyzing sales data for every city across an entire country. That is a lot of data from a lot of different groups–in this case, each city has its own group of data.

Here are a few ways RStudio could help in this situation:

* Using RStudio makes it easy to take a specific analysis step and perform it for each group using basic code. In this example, you could calculate the yearly average sales data for every city.
* RStudio also allows for flexible data visualization. You can visualize differences across the cities effectively using plotting features like facets–which you’ll learn more about later on.
* You can also use RStudio to automatically create an output of summary stats—or even your visualized plots—for each group.

As you learn more about R and RStudio moving forward in this program, you’ll get a better understanding of when RStudio should be your data analysis tool of choice.
