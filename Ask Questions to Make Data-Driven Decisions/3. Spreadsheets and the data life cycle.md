# Spreadsheets and the data life cycle

To better understand the benefits of using spreadsheets in data analytics, let’s explore how they relate to each phase of the data life cycle: **plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive,** and **destroy**.

![illustration of the phases of the data analytics life cycle as a circular graphic](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/lHzyKWuFSKm88ilrheipIA_d3792e86a2fa4cdcbc8729a6cf5e9ac4_DA_C2M3L2R1.png?expiry=1750896000000&hmac=mH0vu5wAdJwS83yp8hQo7c_iVcuTc_RllBwPwhHRZcA)

- **Plan** for the users who will work within a spreadsheet by developing organizational standards. This can mean formatting your cells, the headings you choose to highlight, the color scheme, and the way you order your data points. When you take the time to set these standards, you will improve communication, ensure consistency, and help people be more efficient with their time.
- **Capture** data by the source by connecting spreadsheets to other data sources, such as an online survey application or a database. This data will automatically be updated in the spreadsheet. That way, the information is always as current and accurate as possible.
- **Manage** different kinds of data with a spreadsheet. This can involve storing, organizing, filtering, and updating information. Spreadsheets also let you decide who can access the data, how the information is shared, and how to keep your data safe and secure.
- **Analyze** data in a spreadsheet to help make better decisions. Some of the most common spreadsheet analysis tools include formulas to aggregate data or create reports, and pivot tables for clear, easy-to-understand visuals.
- **Archive** any spreadsheet that you don’t use often, but might need to reference later with built-in tools. This is especially useful if you want to store historical data before it gets updated.
- **Destroy** your spreadsheet when you are certain that you will never need it again, if you have better backup copies, or for legal or security reasons. Keep in mind, lots of businesses are required to follow certain rules or have measures in place to make sure data is destroyed properly.

## Formulas

### **The basics**

After you enter the **=**, most spreadsheet applications will display an autocomplete menu that lists valid formulas, names, and text strings. This is a great way to create and edit formulas while avoiding typing and syntax errors.

### **Mathematical operators** (+, -, /, *)

### **Auto-filling using drag-down**

### **Absolute referencing using $ sign**

### **Data range**

### **Combining with functions** (COUNTIF, SUM, AVG etc.)

# More about spreadsheet errors and fixes

[DAC2 Spreadsheet Errors and Fixes.pdf](https://https://www.coursera.org/api/rest/v1/asset/download/pdf/fDHAQD8OQX6xwEA_DsF-tw?pageStart=&pageEnd=)

When you are new to data analytics—and sometimes even when you aren't—spreadsheet struggles are real. It never feels good when you enter in what you are sure is a perfect formula or function, only to get an error message. Understanding errors and how to fix them is a big part of keeping your data clean, so it’s important to know how to deal with issues as they come up, and more importantly, not to get discouraged.

Even the most advanced spreadsheet users come across problems from time to time.

As a follow-up to what you learned in the previous video, here are a few best practices and helpful tips. These strategies will help you avoid spreadsheet errors to begin with, making your life in analytics a whole lot less stressful:

1. Filter data to make your spreadsheet less complex and busy.
2. Use and freeze headers so you know what is in each column, even when scrolling.
3. When multiplying numbers, use an asterisk (*) not an X.
4. Start every formula and function with an equal sign (=).
5. Whenever you use an open parenthesis, make sure there is a closed parenthesis on the other end to match.
6. Change the font to something easy to read.
7. Set the border colors to white so that you are working in a blank sheet.
8. Create a tab with just the raw data, and a separate tab with just the data you need.

Now that you have learned some basic ways to avoid errors, you can focus on what to do when that dreaded pop-up does appear. The following table is a reference you can use to look up common spreadsheet errors and examples of each. Knowing what the errors mean takes some of the fear out of getting them.

| Error       | Description                                                                                                            | Example                                                                                                                                             |

## Pro tip: Spotting errors in spreadsheets with conditional formatting

Conditional formatting can be used to highlight cells a different color based on their contents. This feature can be extremely helpful when you want to locate all errors in a large spreadsheet. For example, using conditional formatting, you can highlight in yellow all cells that contain an error, and then work to fix them.

### **Conditional formatting in Microsoft Excel** to highlight all cells in a spreadsheet that contain errors:

Home > Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cell Rules > More Rules > Select a Rule Type > Use a formula to determine which cells to format > =ISERROR(A1) > Format > Fill > Color > OK

### **Conditional formatting in Google Sheets** to highlight all cells in a spreadsheet that contain errors:

Format > Conditional Formatting > Single Color > Select Custom formula is > =ISERROR(A1) > select color > Done

# Quick Reference: Functions in spreadsheets

As a quick refresher, a function is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet. Functions give data analysts the ability to do calculations, which can be anything from simple arithmetic to complex equations. Use this reading to help you keep track of some of the most useful options.

## Functions

### **The basics**

- Just like formulas, start all of your functions with an equal sign; for example =SUM. The equal sign tells the spreadsheet that what follows is part of a function, not just a word or number in a cell.
- After you enter the equal sign, most spreadsheet applications will display an autocomplete menu that lists valid functions, names, and text strings. This is a great way to create and edit functions while avoiding typing and syntax errors.
- A fun way to learn new functions is by simply typing an equal sign and a single letter of the alphabet. Choose one of the options that pops up and learn what that function does.

### **Difference between formulas and functions**

- A formula is a set of instructions used to perform a calculation using the data in a spreadsheet.
- A function is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet.

### **Popular functions**

A lot of people don’t realize that keyboard shortcuts like cut, save, and find are actually functions. These functions are built into an application and are amazing time-savers. Using shortcuts lets you do more with less effort. They can make you more efficient and productive because you are not constantly reaching for the mouse and navigating menus. Use these links to discover the most popular shortcuts, for [Chromebook](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183101?hl=en "Chromebook Shortcuts Link"), [PC](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows-dcc61a57-8ff0-cffe-9796-cb9706c75eec "PC Windows Shortcuts"), and [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236 "Mac shortcuts").

### **Auto-filling**

The lower-right corner of each cell has a fill handle. It is a small green square in Microsoft Excel and a small blue circle in Google Sheets.

- Click the fill handle for a cell and drag it down a column to auto-fill other cells in the column with the same formula or function used in that cell.
- Click the fill handle for a cell and drag it across a row to auto-fill other cells in the row with the same formula or function used in that cell.

### **Relative, absolute, and mixed references**

- Relative references (cells referenced without a dollar sign, like **A2**) will change when you copy and paste the function into a different cell. With relative references, the location of the cell that contains the function determines the cells used by the function.
- Absolute references (cells fully referenced with a dollar sign, like **$A$2**) will not change when you copy and paste the function into a different cell. With absolute references, the cells referenced always remain the same.
- Mixed references (cells partially referenced with a dollar sign, like **$A2** or **A$2**) will change when you copy and paste the function into a different cell. With mixed references, the location of the cell that contains the function determines the cells used by the function, but only the row or column is relative (not both).
- In spreadsheets, you can press the **F4** key to toggle between relative, absolute, and mixed references in a function. Click the cell containing the function, highlight the referenced cells in the formula bar, and then press **F4** to toggle between and select relative, absolute, or mixed referencing.

### **Data ranges**

- When you click a cell that contains a function, colored data ranges in the formula bar indicate which cells are being used in the spreadsheet. There are different colors for each unique range in a function.
- Colored data ranges help prevent you from getting lost in complex functions.
- In spreadsheets, you can press the **F2** key to highlight the range of data used by a function. Click the cell containing the function, highlight the range of data used by the function in the formula bar, and then press **F2**. The spreadsheet will go to and highlight the cells specified by the range.
