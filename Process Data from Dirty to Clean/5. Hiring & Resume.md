# The importance of diversity on a data analytics team

As you’ve been learning, there are aspects of data analysis in which bias can play a role. This is why diversity and inclusion are important in data teams and can often be key to taking fair and accurate insights from the data. In this reading, you’re going to explore some of the ways bias can influence data analysis, the ethical considerations of working with data, and how you can mitigate bias.

## Data collection and bias

Even before data is collected, bias might have been involved in determining what data is collected and how. Biased data can lead to inaccurate insights, or it can reinforce existing inequity. An example of this might be a bank that focuses its data collection efforts on predominantly affluent areas. Perhaps residents there have a history of being more profitable bank clients. However, this would exclude lower-income individuals from the bank’s  marketing strategies. A more diverse data team is more likely to notice gaps in data collection and understand the impact on new loan initiatives. Plus, extending loans to a broader base can help banks attract more customers, opening up new markets and revenue streams.

## Data interpretation and bias

Data analysts interpret data to gain insights and guide decision-making. For example, an analyst in a healthcare organization might review data about patient outcomes. If the analyst doesn’t understand or account for disparities in healthcare among various populations, they may present an incomplete report on what the data means. With a diverse group of data analysts, it’s more likely that someone will be familiar with these disparities and factor in additional data to create a more complete picture. For example, a diverse team analyzing healthcare data may notice that a particular study on heart disease focuses primarily on male participants. Team members may recognize this gender bias and recommend conducting a similar study with a more balanced representation of all participants to understand sex-specific risk factors.

## Ethical considerations

Data analysts often have access to a great deal of data and must consider what's right and fair when collecting and interpreting it. It’s important to establish and follow ethical guidelines for data use, some of which are included below:

- **Informed consent:** Obtain informed and voluntary consent from individuals before collecting their data. This ensures that people are aware of how their data will be used and gives them the opportunity to make an informed decision about data sharing.
- **Anonymity and confidentiality:** Protect the privacy of individuals through de-identification and confidentiality measures. This guideline helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and maintains trust in data handling.
- **Data security:** Implement robust data security measures to safeguard data from breaches and unauthorized access. Data security is foundational for protecting individuals' information.
- **Transparency:** Transparency in data use practices is critical for building trust. Clearly communicate how data is collected, processed, and shared.
- **Data ownership and control:**  Make sure to give people control over their data, including the ability to access, correct, or delete it.

If your team is small or lacks diversity, there are steps you can take to identify and mitigate bias in data collection and analysis:

- Educate yourself on unconscious bias and its impact on data analysis.
- Review data collection methods to find and fix bias in tools and survey questions.
- Be transparent in documenting all aspects of your data collection and analysis methods to allow others to review and identify potential biases in your methodology.
- Consult with diverse data experts and seek peer reviews from colleagues with diverse perspectives.
- Engage in continuous learning and in discussions with other data analysts to stay up to date on the latest research and techniques.

# Add technical skills to your resume

Technical skills are crucial when building a solid resume. They demonstrate to employers that you have the skills necessary to successfully perform the job. Think of technical skills as your toolbox: How you list each skill on your resume is how you demonstrate to employers that you are capable of using those tools.

## Common technical skills for entry-level data analysts

It takes lots of skills to be a successful data analyst, and these are some common ones that employers seek out when hiring for data analyst jobs:

**1. Structured Query Language (SQL):** SQL is considered a basic skill that is pivotal to any entry-level data analyst position. SQL helps you communicate with databases, and more specifically, it is designed to help you retrieve information from databases. Every month, thousands of data analyst jobs posted require SQL, and knowing how to use SQL remains one of the most common job functions of a data analyst.

**2. Spreadsheets:** Although SQL is popular, 62% of companies still prefer to use spreadsheets for their data insights. When getting your first job as a data analyst, the first version of your database might be in spreadsheet form, which is still a powerful tool for reporting or even presenting data sets. So, it is important for you to be familiar with using spreadsheets for your data insights.

**3. Data visualization tools:** Data visualization tools help to simplify complex data and enable the data to be visually understood. After gathering and analyzing data, data analysts are tasked with presenting their findings and making that information simple to grasp. Common tools that are used in data analysis include Tableau, Microstrategy, Data Studio, Looker, Datarama, Microsoft Power BI, and many more. Among these, Tableau is best known for its ease of use, so it is a must-have for beginner data analysts. Also, studies show that data analysis jobs requiring Tableau are expected to grow about 34.9% over the next decade.

**4**. **R or Python programming:** Since only less than a third of entry-level data analyst positions require knowledge of Python or R, you don’t need to be proficient in programming languages as an entry-level data analyst. But, R or Python are great additions to have as you become more advanced in your career.

# Add professional skills to your resume

There is more than just data when it comes to being a data analyst—there are plenty of professional skills that can set you apart from other candidates so that potential employers will notice you and know that you have the ability to succeed in this role. Here are some of the most common professional skills you will find in an entry-level data analyst resume.

Presentation skills, collaboration, communication, research, problem-solving skills, adaptability, attention to detail.

1.**Presentation skills**
Although gathering and analyzing data is a big part of the job, presenting your findings in a clear and simple way is just as important. You will want to structure your findings in a way that allows your audience to know exactly what conclusions they are supposed to draw.

2.**Collaboration**
As a data analyst, you will be asked to work with lots of teams and stakeholders—sometimes internal or external—and your ability to share ideas, insights, and criticisms will be crucial. It is important that you and your team—which might consist of engineers and researchers—do your best to get the job done.

3.**Communication**
Data analysts must communicate effectively to obtain the data that they need. It is also important that you are able to work and clearly communicate with teams and business leaders in a language that they understand.

4.**Research**
As a data analyst, even if you have all of the data at your disposal, you still need to analyze it and draw crucial insights from it. To analyze the data and draw conclusions, you will need to conduct research to stay in-line with industry trends.

5.**Problem-solving skills**
Problem-solving is a big part of a data analyst’s job, and you will encounter times when there are errors in databases, code, or even the capturing of data. You will have to adapt and think outside the box to find alternative solutions to these problems.

6.**Adaptability**
In the ever-changing world of data, you have to be adaptable and flexible. As a data analyst, you will be working across multiple teams with different levels of needs and knowledge, which requires you to adjust to different teams, knowledge levels, and stakeholders.

7.**Attention to detail**
A single line of incorrect code can throw everything off, so paying attention to detail is critical for a data analyst. When it comes to understanding and reporting findings, it helps if you focus on the details that matter to your audience.

### Adding professional skills to your resume

Here are a few ways that you can add professional skills to your resume:

1. Analyze your previous work experience and find opportunities to insert a professional skill. For example, if you worked in a restaurant, you could emphasize your communication and adaptability skills that you utilized to effectively function during peak hours.
