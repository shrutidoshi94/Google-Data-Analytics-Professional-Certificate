# My Google Data Analytics Journey – From Zero to Data Hero!

![SDlovesGDA](SDlovesGDA.gif)

Welcome to my humble archive of chapter-wise notes and case studies created during my epic quest to earn the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** on **Coursera**! 🎓

##  Who Am I?

Just your friendly neighborhood non-techie, bravely diving headfirst into the mysterious world of Data Analytics. I once thought SQL was complex, R was a pirate’s favorite letter, and spreadsheets were just for grocery lists.
But guess what? I survived! And dare I say… I kinda loved it?

## My Data Analysis Map

Following the holy grail of analysis:
	
1.	Ask – “What problem am I solving?” (Spoiler: it’s often confusion.)
2.	Prepare – Clean data, clear mind.
3.	Process – Turn messy data into… slightly less messy data.
4.	Analyze – SQL/R wizardry in action.
5.	Share – Visualizations so beautiful they’d make your boss cry.
6.	Act – Turn insights into action (or at least into a nicely formatted report).

## Tech Stack 
**Google Sheets** – My gateway drug.

**R** – For when I wanted to feel fancy.

**SQL** – The magical language of databases.

**Tableau** – Art expression.

## Lessons Learned

- Spreadsheets are secretly powerful.
- SQL is like talking to a very strict librarian.
- R will make you cry… and then feel proud.
- Data doesn’t lie, but it does hide.
- Coffee is not optional.

## Final Words

This repo is a my love letter to the journey of learning something completely new and occasionally shouting “Wow, I did that!” in the middle of the night.
If you’re from a non-tech background and thinking about diving into data — DO IT. It’s not just charts and code; it’s storytelling with a geeky twist.
Feel free to explore, borrow, laugh, or even raise a pull request if you want to correct my notes (please be gentle 😅).
