# My Google Data Analytics Journey – From Zero to Data Hero!

![SDlovesGDA](SDlovesGDA.gif)

Welcome to my humble archive of chapter-wise notes and case studies created during my epic quest to earn the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** on **Coursera**! 🎓

## Who Am I?

Just your friendly neighborhood non-techie, bravely diving headfirst into the mysterious world of Data Analytics. I once thought SQL was complex.
But guess what? I survived! And dare I say… I kinda loved it?

What’s Inside This Repository?

1. Chapter-wise content from the course. Neatly organized, with visuals.
2. Real-world case studies where I flexed my newfound data muscles.


## My Data Analysis Map

Following the holy grail of analysis:

1. Ask – “What problem am I solving?” (Spoiler: it’s often confusion.)
2. Prepare – Clean data, clear mind.
3. Process – Turn messy data into… slightly less messy data.
4. Analyze – SQL/R wizardry in action.
5. Share – Visualizations so beautiful they’d make your boss cry.
6. Act – Turn insights into action (or at least into a nicely formatted report).


## Tech Stack

**Google Sheets**

**R** 

**SQL** 

**Tableau** 


## Final Words

This repo is a my love letter to the journey of learning something completely new and occasionally shouting “Wow, I did that!” in the middle of the night.
If you’re from a non-tech background and thinking about diving into data — DO IT. It’s not just charts and code; it’s storytelling with a geeky twist.
Feel free to explore, borrow, laugh, or even raise a pull request if you want to correct my notes (please be gentle 😅).

**Happy Analyzing!**
