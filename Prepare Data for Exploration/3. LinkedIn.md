# Get started with LinkedIn

## Signing up

Signing up with LinkedIn is simple. Just follow these simple steps:

1. Browse to [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/ "This link takes you to the LinkedIn home page.")
2. Click **Join now** or **Join with resume**.

If you clicked **Join now**:

1. Enter your email address and a password and click **Agree & Join** (or click **Join with Google** to link to a Google account).
2. Enter your first and last name and click **Continue**.
3. Enter your country/region, your postal code, and location with the area (this helps LinkedIn find job opportunities near you).
4. Enter your most recent job title, or select **I’m a student**.
5. If you entered your most recent job title, select your employment type and enter the name of your most recent company.
6. If you selected self-employed or freelance, LinkedIn will ask for your industry.
7. Click confirm your email address. You will receive an email from LinkedIn.
8. To confirm your email address, click **Agree & Confirm** in your email.
9. LinkedIn will then ask if you are looking for a job. Click the answer that applies. If you select Yes, LinkedIn will help you start looking for job opportunities.

If you clicked **Join with resume**:

1. Click **Upload your resume** and select the file to upload.
2. Follow any of the steps under **Join Now** that are relevant.

The Join with resume option saves you some time because it auto-fills most of the information from your resume. And just like that, your initial profile is now ready!

## Including basic information in your profile

It is a good idea to take your time filling out every section of your profile. This helps recruiters find your profile and helps people you connect with get to know you better. Start with your photo. Here are some tips to help you choose a great picture for your new profile:

* Choose an image that looks like you: You want to make sure that your profile is the best representation of you and that includes your photo. You want a potential connection or potential employer to be able to recognize you from your profile picture if you were to meet.
* Use your industry as an example: If you are having trouble deciding what is appropriate for your profile image, look at other profiles in the same industry or from companies you are interested in to get a better sense of what you should be doing.
* Choose a high-resolution image: The better the resolution, the better impression it makes, so make sure the image you choose isn’t blurry. The ideal image size for a LinkedIn profile picture is 400 x 400 pixels. Use a photo where your face takes up at least 60% of the space in the frame.
* Remember to smile: Your profile picture is a snapshot of who you are as a person so it is okay to be serious in your photo. But smiling helps put potential connections and potential employers at ease.

## Adding connections

Connections are a great way to keep up to date with your previous coworkers, colleagues, classmates, or even companies you want to work with. The world is a big place with a lot of people. So here are some tips to help get you started.

1. Connect to people you know personally.
2. Add a personal touch to your invitation message. Instead of just letting them know you would like to connect, let them know why.
3. Make sure your profile picture is current so people can recognize you.
4. Add value. Provide them with a resource, a website link, or even some content they might find interesting in your invitation to connect.

## Finding leaders and influencers

LinkedIn is a great place to find great people and great ideas. From technology to marketing, and everything in between, there are all kinds of influencers and thought leaders active on LinkedIn. If you have ever wanted to know the thoughts of some of the most influential and respected minds in a certain field, LinkedIn is a great place to start. Following your favorite people takes only a few minutes. You can search for people or companies individually, or you can use these lists as starting points.

[Top influencers on LinkedIn ](https://lists.linkedin.com/2015/top-voices/influencers "This link takes you to a list of the top influencers on LinkedIn published by LinkedIn.")[LinkedIn Top Voices 2020: Data Science & AI](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-voices-2020-data-science-ai-jessi-hempel/ "This link takes you to a LinkedIn article that identifies top influencers in science and AI in 2020.")

## Looking for a new position

On LinkedIn, letting recruiters and potential employers know that you are in the market for a new job is simple. Just follow these steps:

1. Click the **Me** icon at the top of your LinkedIn homepage.
2. Click **View profile**.
3. Click the blue **Open to** button prompting a drop-down menu and under Intro, select **Finding a new job**.
4. Provide the requested job title and location requests within the pop-up window.
5. When you are done updating, click on the **Save** button which will add the tags to your public profile.

Make sure to select the appropriate filters for the new positions you might be looking for and update your profile to better fit the role that you are applying for.

## Keeping your profile up to date

Add to your profile to keep it complete, current, and interesting. For example, remember to add the Google Data Analytics Certificate to your profile after you complete the program!

# Build connections on LinkedIn

## Using LinkedIn to connect

A **connection** is someone you know and trust on a personal or professional basis. Your connections are who make up your network. And when it comes to your network, it is important to remember quality over quantity. So don’t focus on how many connections you have. Instead, make sure that everyone you connect with adds value to your network, and vice versa.

## Inviting those you know versus making cold requests

Adding connections on LinkedIn is easy. You invite people to join your network, and they accept your invitation. When you send an invitation, you can attach a personal note. Personal notes are highly recommended.

A great way to increase the number of your connections is to invite classmates, friends, teachers, or even members of a club or organization you are in. LinkedIn also gives suggestions for connections based on your profile information. Here's an example (template) that you can use to connect with a former co-worker:

![Image of personalized LinkedIn message with an illustration of a former co-worker.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/rJZQuI9QToyWULiPUO6MWA_da7e3c813c734f389f43bfa6e6bd365e_Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-3.05.47-PM.png?expiry=1750896000000&hmac=KY7zYBtWqgKtFNyNbS_ExsutYGEBrny-SlEG8XyWn1k)The message:
Hi `<fill in name here>`,

Please accept my invitation to connect. It has been a while since we were at `<fill in company name here>` and I look forward to catching up with you. I’m looking for job opportunities and would love to hear about what you’re doing and who is hiring in your organization.

Best regards,
`<fill in your name here>`

Cold requests on LinkedIn are invitations to connect with people you don’t know personally or professionally. When you start to build your network, it is best to connect with people you already know. But cold requests might be the only way to connect with people who work at companies you are interested in. You can learn a lot about a company’s culture and job openings from current employees. As a best practice, send cold requests rarely and only when there is no other way to connect.

## Asking for recommendations (references)

Recommendations on LinkedIn are a great way to have others vouch for you. Ask people to comment on your past performance, how you handled a challenging project, or your strengths as a data analyst. You can choose to accept, reject, show, or hide recommendations in your profile.

Here are some tips for asking for a recommendation:

* Reach out to a variety of people for a 360-degree view: supervisors, co-workers, direct reports, partners, and clients
* Personalize the recommendation request with a custom message
* Suggest strengths and capabilities they can highlight as part of your request
* Be willing to write a recommendation in return
* Read the recommendation carefully before you accept it into your profile

Sometimes the hardest part of getting a recommendation is creating the right request message. Here's an example (template) that you can use to ask for a recommendation:

![Image of personalized LinkedIn message with an illustration of a former co-worker.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Kv-aZDE1SbS_mmQxNUm0ow_425899b44a1e41e581b4676df13e893a_Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-3.08.05-PM.png?expiry=1750896000000&hmac=IicMeUOAvr_vTmacH5RjN7K5qOK_5MRQLrMRejKLZWA)Hi `<fill in name here>`,
How are you? I hope you are well. I’m preparing for a new job search and would appreciate it if you could write a recommendation that highlights my `<insert your specific skill here>`. Our experience working on `<insert project here>` is a great example and I would be happy to provide other examples if you need them. Please let me know if I can write a recommendation for you. I would be very glad to return the favor.
Thanks in advance for your support!
`<fill in your name here>`

Ask a few connections to recommend you and highlight why you should be hired. Recommendations help prospective employers get a better idea of who you are and the quality of your work.

# Develop a network

In this reading, you will be introduced to online and in-person opportunities to connect with other data analysts. This is part of how you develop professional relationships, which is very important when you are just starting out in your career

![Image of two people icons, one is red and the other is blue connected by a circle](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wt4AqgkzSl2eAKoJM5pdxw_dc3ec364c53b4fdc88e4250fbdf2efc2_Screen-Shot-2021-03-04-at-11.22.52-PM.png?expiry=1750896000000&hmac=orZyThrKPq9cRXa-xQcKd89hIUD1GxGUnce2vt9Tapg)

## Online connections

If you spend a few hours on social media every day you might be totally comfortable connecting with other data analysts online. But, where should you look if you don’t know any data analysts?

Even if you aren’t on social media and just created your LinkedIn profile yesterday, you can still use your online presence to find and network with other data analysts.

Knowing where to look is key. Here are some suggestions on where to start online:

* **Subscriptions** to newsletters like [Data Elixir](https://dataelixir.com/). Not only will this give you a treasure trove of useful information on a regular basis, but you will also learn the names of data science experts who you can follow, or possibly even connect with if you have good reason to.
* **Hackathons** (competitions) like those sponsored by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), one of the largest data science and machine learning communities in the world. Participating in a hackathon might not be for everyone. But after joining a community, you typically have access to forums where you can chat and connect with other data analysts.
* **Meetups**, or online meetings that are usually local to your geography. Enter a search for ‘data science meetups near me’ to see what results you get. There is usually a posted schedule for upcoming meetings so you can attend virtually to meet other data analysts. Find out more information about [meetups happening around the world](https://www.meetup.com/topics/data-analytics/).
* **Platforms** like LinkedIn and Twitter. Use a search on either platform to find data science or data analysis hashtags to follow. You can also post your own questions or articles to generate responses and build connections that way. At the time of this writing, the LinkedIn #dataanalyst hashtag had 11,842 followers, the #dataanalytics hashtag had 98,412 followers, and the #datascience hashtag had 746,945 followers. Many of the same hashtags work on Twitter and even on Instagram.
* Webinars may showcase a panel of speakers and are usually recorded for convenient access and playback. You can see who is on a webinar panel and follow them too. Plus, a lot of webinars are free. One interesting pick is the [Tableau on Tableau webinar series](https://www.tableau.com/learn/series/how-we-do-data). Find out how Tableau has used Tableau in its internal departments.

## In-person (offline) gatherings

![Image of a group of people smiling and hanging out](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_FabF3U-Riq-nsrwhDIG5A_69247aeff04243dc96743e5a5337abe1_fIHA-q4tRfxxWz3HSNZMVpazcKDpHAOV5nQpA05YyAq7-uuhrCoX1lnK3kxOGNTyUdV4IhQ6tHF3-zUIFxA7jFEUJX11bp7-4eflB-qHQZ1mGan_fvLFERKMCz_nQMGUVS9RW2o6VBWFMiVZ8lYvpg?expiry=1750896000000&hmac=QVyAw7WlKHwAFGbKICvOSsIfhH1SSTdpTdQiH7mItWo)

In-person gatherings are super valuable in a digitized world. They are a great way to meet people. A lot of online relationships start from in-person gatherings and are carried on after people return home. Many organizations that sponsor annual gatherings also offer virtual meetings and resources during the rest of the year.

Here are a few suggestions to find in-person gatherings in your area:

* **Conferences** usually present innovative ideas and topics. The cost of conferences vary, and some are pricey. But lots of conferences offer discounts to students and some conferences like [Women in Analytics](https://womeninanalytics.com/about/) aim to increase the number of under-represented groups in the field. Leading research and advisory companies such as [Gartner](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/common/conference-calendar/gartner-conference-calendar.pdf) also sponsor conferences for data and analytics. The [KDNuggets list of meetings and online events](https://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/index.html) for AI, analytics, big data, data science, and machine learning is useful.
* **Associations** or **societies** gather members to promote a field like data science. Many memberships are free. The [KDNuggets list of societies and group](https://www.kdnuggets.com/websites/societies.html)s for analytics, data mining, data science, and knowledge discovery is useful.
* **User communities** and **summits** offer events for users of data analysis tools; this is a chance to learn from the best. Have you seen the [Tableau community](https://community.tableau.com/s/)?
* **Non-profit organizations** that promote the ethical use of data science and might offer events for the professional advancement of their members. The [Data Science Association](https://www.datascienceassn.org/) is one example.
